## *What is it?*
- ### This web app uses NodeJS, Express, MONGODB and Mongoose to save and retrieve user inputted notes. I created this web app to facilitate note taking when learning computer science related technical skills. Most of my technicals skills I learn through youtube and Udemy courses, so instead of creating a google docs for each video or lesson, I thought having a web app where each language has its own notes would save me a lot of time.
